# TEXT-COMPRESSION
## OBJECTIVE
This is a programming assignment which requires you to design and implement LZW encoder.

## INPUT
A bmp file of size >1 MB of your choice.

## EXPERIMENT 1:
Implement the LZW encoder and test against an initial dictionary consisting of the letters a b r y ·, then encode the following message using the LZW algorithm: a· bar· array· by· barrayar· bay.Now, convert the bmp file to a binary string and use your LZW encoder to find a compressed code. Calculate the compression ratio achieved.
