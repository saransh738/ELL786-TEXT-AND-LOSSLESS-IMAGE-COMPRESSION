# TEXT-COMPRESSION
## OBJECTIVE
This is a programming assignment which requires you to design and implement LZW encoder.

## INPUT
A bmp file of size >1 MB of your choice.

## EXPERIMENT 1:
Implement the LZW encoder and test against an initial dictionary consisting of the letters a b r y ·, then encode the following message using the LZW algorithm: a· bar· array· by· barrayar· bay.Now, convert the bmp file to a binary string and use your LZW encoder to find a compressed code. Calculate the compression ratio achieved.

## EXPERIMENT 2:
Convert the bmp file to a binary string and use gif encoder to find a compressed code. Calculate the compression ratio achieved. Study “IMAGE COMPRESSION—THE GRAPHICS INTERCHANGE FORMAT (GIF)” and compare the compression achieved by gif versus your LZW encoder.Explain additional techniques used in gif.

## EXPERIMENT 3:
Convert the bmp file to a binary string and use png encoder to find a compressed code. Calculate the compression ratio achieved. Study “IMAGE COMPRESSION—PORTABLE NETWORK GRAPHICS (PNG)” and compare the compression achieved by png versus your LZW encoder. Explain additional techniques used in png.

# LOSSLESS-IMAGE-COMPRESSION
## EXPERIMENT 4:
Read an image from an existing .png file. Compress this image data to a sequence of bytes. Compression technique to be used in this experiment is JPEG-LS. Note the size of the image before compression and after compression for the RGB Image , PNG encoded file and JPEG-LS encoded file. Now obtain PSNR values of the encoded files before and after compression. State your reasons for conclusion.
